In the upcoming Fall of 2022, we are looking for members to join us in our mission of creating social good through the use of computer science. Through technology, we have the opportunity to be a part of positive change and evolution of a growing world of possibility. We aim to give nonprofits and organizations for social good in the Chapel Hill area the tools to effectively complete their goals with the use of knowledge and programs.
