<h2 id="content">About the Education Team</h2>

<p>
Hello everyone, welcome to the CS+SG Education Team! My name is <strong>Ajay Gandecha</strong>, and I am the Education Team lead this semester. I am excited to teach all of you this semester!
<br><br>
The CS+SG Education Team focuses on aqcuiring full-stack development skills so you can use these skills on real-world projects for social good. CS+SG's development teams create high-quality web applications using React.js. Throughout this semester, you will have the chance to learn about these technologies and practice implementing them in your own projects.
</p>

<h2 id="content">Education Team Curriculum</h2>

<p>
The CS+SG Education Team Curriculum is comprised of <strong>seven core lessons</strong> that cover the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. These technologies are at the core of all of the projects that the CS+SG production teams work on, and are important skills to know on your journey towards the mastery full-stack development fundamentals.
<br><br>
In addition to these lessons are <strong>projects</strong> that correspond each lesson! The completion of these projects will allow Edu Team members to practice the skills they learn in each lesson. At the end of the semester, Edu Team members will submit their completed projects and have a chance to showcase them to the rest of the production teams.
<br><br>
There will also be <strong>guest lectures</strong> scattered throughout the semester taught by members of the UNC CS community. These lectures will enhance your skills when working on projects.

        The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concepts of web development. Students will be taught the basics of structuring websites with HTML, and styling websites with CSS. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for using tags to represent structural objects, which will be used extensively with React Components, and for styling components.
