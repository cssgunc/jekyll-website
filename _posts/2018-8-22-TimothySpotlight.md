Timothy is CS+SG's treasurer. He's in the Class of 2021 and is majoring in Business Administration. We asked Timothy to answer a few questions about himself.

### What internships/experiences have you had have had a lasting impact on you?

This past summer, I interned at an investment bank in Shanghai. The experience was very eyeopening in the sense that I was able to get a grasp of China's professional culture. My time spent interning helped me become more aware of Chinese culture and gain real work experience in my potential work field. 

### What do you want for your life after college?

My best case scenario would be working in New York, either at an investment bank or another financial institution.

### What has CS+SG given you as a person?

I've always been interested in computer science and through CS+SG I'm able to give back to the community utilizing my business skills. 

### What's a fun fact about yourself?

I eat 5 meals a day!
