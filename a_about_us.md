				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Technology is one of the most powerful tools that we have widespread access to as a society. As we continue to develop its possibilities, it is important that we understand the repercussions of our actions and find a way to use tech to help create social good. I hope that CS+SG will be a start for us, as a community, to make a positive impact on the people around us and help to develop a healthier relationship with the way we use computer science for good.</p>

				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Self-proclaimed technologists and "startup heros" often proclaim their passion as inventing technologies to "change the world for the better". However, I firmly believe that a more useful strategy is to help existing organizations learn about and utilize freely-available technology in a manner which helps them achieve their ongoing missions. I also believe that through CS+Social Good we can help people understand how to take control of the digital tools in their lives, and in doing so move towards a world in which our devices respect our privacy, freedoms, and help us to achieve our goals.</p>

				</p>
				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>I think everyone has an obligation to use their skills and talents to make a positive impact on others, whatever that may be.  A lot of organizations in the community have no idea how much more they could be accomplishing with technology, or just don't have the tools to accomplish it.  Every time we empower an organization with technology, we help them as well as all the people they help through their mission, and it's a great feeling.</p>

				<h2>Graphics & Technology Chair</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='grad-date'>May 2020</span>,
					B.S. in Computer Science, B.S. in Mathematics
				</p>
				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>I think there are a lot of worthy causes that need just a little technological guidance. Even as students, we can do small & simple things to lend a hand. I think CS+SG is a great way to open up more diverse opportunities for CS majors. CS+SG can help students who aren't interested in tech/finance/academia discover new career paths.</p>
				<h4>Fun facts about me!</h4>
				<p>I hang out in the Hackerspace (SN0027) a lot during the school year. Feel free to drop by! My favorite season is winter. I tell myself I don't have a favorite color, but I think it's either orange or blue.</p>
