				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Technology is one of the most powerful tools that we have widespread access to as a society. As we continue to develop its possibilities, it is important that we understand the repercussions of our actions and find a way to use tech to help create social good. I hope that CS+SG will be a start for us, as a community, to make a positive impact on the people around us and help to develop a healthier relationship with the way we use computer science for good.</p>
				<h4>Fun facts about me!</h4>
				<p>In my spare time, I like to listen to jazz, bake, knit and watch the Office.</p>

				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Self-proclaimed technologists and "startup heros" often proclaim their passion as inventing technologies to "change the world for the better". However, I firmly believe that a more useful strategy is to help existing organizations learn about and utilize freely-available technology in a manner which helps them achieve their ongoing missions. I also believe that through CS+Social Good we can help people understand how to take control of the digital tools in their lives, and in doing so move towards a world in which our devices respect our privacy, freedoms, and help us to achieve our goals.</p>

				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>With great power comes great responsibility. My favorite part about computer science is that any individual, from any background, can use it as a tool for good. I'm passionate about CS+SG because it empowers students from all walks of life to collaborate and use our growing skills to help our community.</p>
				<h4>Fun facts about me!</h4>
				<p>I'm a certified yoga teacher, and I'm passionate about teaching communities who may benefit from it most -- at-risk youth, cancer patients and survivors, and veterans with combat stress and PTSD. </p>

				<h2>Graphics & Technology Chair</h2>

					<span class='grad-date'>May 2020</span>,

				</p>
				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>I think there are a lot of worthy causes that need just a little technological guidance. Even as students, we can do small & simple things to lend a hand. I think CS+SG is a great way to open up more diverse opportunities for CS majors. CS+SG can help students who aren't interested in tech/finance/academia discover new career paths.</p>
				<h4>Fun facts about me!</h4>
				<p>I hang out in the Hackerspace (SN0027) a lot during the school year. Feel free to drop by! My favorite season is winter. I tell myself I don't have a favorite color, but I think it's either orange or blue.</p>
