				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Technology is one of the most powerful tools that we have widespread access to as a society. As we continue to develop its possibilities, it is important that we understand the repercussions of our actions and find a way to use tech to help create social good. I hope that CS+SG will be a start for us, as a community, to make a positive impact on the people around us and help to develop a healthier relationship with the way we use computer science for good.</p>
				<h4>Fun facts about me!</h4>
				<p>In my spare time, I like to listen to jazz, bake, knit and watch the Office.</p>

				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>Self-proclaimed technologists and "startup heros" often proclaim their passion as inventing technologies to "change the world for the better". However, I firmly believe that a more useful strategy is to help existing organizations learn about and utilize freely-available technology in a manner which helps them achieve their ongoing missions. I also believe that through CS+Social Good we can help people understand how to take control of the digital tools in their lives, and in doing so move towards a world in which our devices respect our privacy, freedoms, and help us to achieve our goals.</p>

				</p>
				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>I think everyone has an obligation to use their skills and talents to make a positive impact on others, whatever that may be.  A lot of organizations in the community have no idea how much more they could be accomplishing with technology, or just don't have the tools to accomplish it.  Every time we empower an organization with technology, we help them as well as all the people they help through their mission, and it's a great feeling.</p>

				</p>
				<h4>Why are you passionate about CS+SG?</h4>
				<p>I think that we, as CS majors, tend to underestimate the scope of our own influence. A lot of us have a one track mind hooked on a lucrative job market and research opportunities. We often overlook the ways in which we can impact areas outside of our bubble. I hope CS+SG creates passion in environmental science, healthcare, social justice, and more for CS students. *DAB*</p>
